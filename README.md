# ytl
Dumb downloader for youtube links. Linux only atm. Relies on youtube-dl, which it can download with the -u option.

Project is simple: take a file with a youtube URL in it, pass the URL to youtube-dl with some options (baked in), ???, profit.

PASSES FIRST LINE OF .ytl FILES COMPLETELY UNEDITED, USE NON-USER CREATED FILES AT YOUR OWN PERIL
